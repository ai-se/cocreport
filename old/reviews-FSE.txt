PAPER: 33\
TITLE: On the Value of Parametric Software Effort Estimation\
AUTHORS: Tim Menzies, Yang Ye, George Mathew, Barry Boehm and Jairus Hihn\
\
\
----------- SUMMARY AND EVALUATION -----------\
The paper is a mix of polemic and experimental investigation that\
seeks to compare different classes of software cost model.\'a0 COCOMO,\
sometimes recalibrated is compared with a benchmark LOC method and CBR\
for various COCOMO datasets. Although there are comments about\
regression trees I dodn't see any results.\
\
\
COMMENTS\
\
There is a need to be clear what is meant by a parametric model. Of\
course formally it is any distribution that can be described by a\
model with a finite number of parameters. But I guess the authors have\
a more particular view.\
\
And in terms of comparisons with LOC for RQ1 (I assume the authors\
mean a linear relationship so that b=1).\'a0 But in what sense is such a\
model not a special form of parametric models in general?\
\
RQ5 what does unduly sensitive mean?\
\
If COC05 and NASA10 are proprietary and it\'92s essential to use them,\
the experiments should be repeated with and without them so there\'92s at\
least something that can be replicated/benchmarked by the rest of the\
community.\
\
There seem to be problems with some of the references e.g. is ref [46]\
appropriate for feature synthesis? Ref [59] seems reasonable for CBR\
but not for regression trees (p1). Ref [6] is inappropriate. Ref [62]\
has a broken link.\'a0 I haven\'92t checked all the references but there are\
sufficient errors to cause me concern.\
\
There is already some published work based on a formal sensitivity\
analysis of COCOMO by Wagner 2007.\'a0 Since as your text hints at there\
are analytic solutions why do you tackle this problem experimentally?\
Moreover the discussion makes no sense in that the question being\
asked relates to LOC so I fail to follow the argument about other\
variables.\
\
\
p1 When COCOMO is being discussed in the Intro which version?\'a0 Simple?\
\
What work with the Chinese and US software industries (p1)?\'a0 Either\
cite or if this work is unpublished provide some details.\'a0 Otherwise\
such statements are unhelpful.\
\
p2 The authors need to explain what fundamentals they believe are\
embedded in COCOMO (or may be all parametric models - it\'92s unclear)?\
How does Delphi fit with parametric modeling or any of the RQs?\
\
p2 Who subscribes to the \'91myth\'92 that "no one used model- based\
estimation and that estimates are always better done using\
expert-based guess-timation\'94?\'a0 Also I\'92m unclear whether this is one or\
two myths? This is merely constructing a straw man.\
\
p2 Since when have Delphi methods been seen as synonymous with\
"expert-based guess-timation\'94?\
\
p2 Ref [6] provides no information whatsoever on whether Delphi is or\
isn\'92t a 'common practice'.\
\
Figs 4-5 seem redundant\
\
p4 The trimming of 23 variables is reasonable if it can be assumed\
that they are all summative i.e. is measure on the same dimension.\
\
p4 The calibration technique looks like a greedy search that assumes\
limited interaction between a and b.\
\
p5 The literature is full of articles debunking ratio based\
performance measures such as MRE e.g. . Why do you use it?\
\
p5 Equation 3 needs explanation.\'a0 If it means the distance between x\
and y is determined using a set of features 1\uc0\u8804 i\u8804 n where there are n\
features then is odd since as far as I understand the text you\'92re only\
only using LOC?\
\
p5 In what sense does a Knear method differ from basic case-based\
reasoning where you use k-NN?\'a0 Is this an unhelpful proliferation of\
terminology?\
\
p6 I\'92m not familiar with Vargha and Delaney\'92s A_\{12\} statistic but on\
the face of it looks similar to the well known Cliff\'92s delta.\'a0 Why\
don\'92t you use this? BTW in the unnumbered equation you miss the case\
of x < y = 0 (for completeness).\
\
p6 LOC performs so \'91badly\'92 because unlike your other parametric models\
you are simply trying to fit with a slope coefficient a (and assuming\
a zero intercept).\'a0 This isn\'92t much to do with LOC but the constraints\
you\'92re imposing on your parametric model.\
\
p9 Where does Figure 13 come from?\'a0 This looks like quite different\
work which seems unrelated to the previous analysis. How does it fit\
with any of the researc questions?\'a0 It seems like a last minute add\
on.\

----------- STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES -----------\
+ A challenging and bold set of research questions\
+ The book Software Engineering Economics was a landmark in its time\
(1981) which contains much wisdom and insight mainly unrelated to\
CCOMO.\
\
- Ignores related work e.g. independent empirical evaluations such as\
Kemerer (1987). Applying COCOMO to new data sets would be instructive.\
- The organisation is poor so the paper meaders e.g. the section on\
Delphi which is unrelated to the research questions? Then an\
unnecessary section on the history of COCOMO. The analysis in Figure\
13 seems unrelated.\
- There are very many errors\
- It makes huge generalizations e.g. there are an infinite number of\
possible models so how is it meaningful to compare parametric models\
with \'92innovative\'92 methods?\
- The research questions are ill specified or meaningless\
- Using the COCOMO datasets to which this model was \'91fitted\'92\
undermines the generality of the answers.\
- The conclusion "the continued use of parametric estimation can still\
be endorsed.\'94 (p1) is unwarranted.\

PAPER: 33\
TITLE: On the Value of Parametric Software Effort Estimation\
AUTHORS: Tim Menzies, Yang Ye, George Mathew, Barry Boehm and Jairus Hihn\
\
\
----------- SUMMARY AND EVALUATION -----------\
The paper compares a sample of an in the 1970s developed parametric software\
effort estimation method with some newer innovations for software effort\
estimation, based on a set of COCOMO-related datasets. The comparison\
focusses on the use of just Lines-of-Code as a basis for estimations to\
parametric estimation and the effect of some innovations on effort\
estimation. Outcome of the comparison is that no remarkable differences are\
found, the researchers conclude that use of parametric methods is still a\
valid and recommended practice.\
\
\
Software effort estimation is an important topic of great practical\
relevance, so it is good to see a paper on this topic submitted to\
FSE.\
\
The questions asked about parametric approaches are relevant, and the\
explanation of COCOMO and COCONUT are adequate.\
The methodological approach seems sound, and the experimental outcomes\
interesting.\
\
Unfortunately, the paper itself is not very well organized, and\
unnecessarily opiniated.\
\
The explanation of planning poker could take into account that agile\
methods focus on situations that are *change*-intensive: Agile methods\
take as starting point that up front the requirements will not be\
clear, and hence that short iterations are important. Instead, as the\
paper explains, COCOMO is primarily useful in upfront calculations.\
Both approaches have their value, but in very different circumstances.\
\
The paper's exposition of Delphi-based methods is inadequate.\'a0 The\
paper should explain a bit about the history of the Delphi *method*,\
as proposed by RAND and later expanded and analyzed by Boehm, author\
of the present paper.\'a0 Instead the present paper just contains a\
footnote referencing the ancient Delphi oracle. This is not helpful,\
and not neutral, as it dismisses the method it would like to contrast\
with as irreproducible.\
\
"all the model-based methods studied in this paper can generate\
estimates in just a few seconds."\
Well, assuming the 27 COCOMO inputs have been collected, which is of\
course the real work.\
\
"Assuming 7.5 hour day". Why?\
\
"Menzies' preferred local calibration procedure is ..."\
Why should we care about Menzies personal opinions?\
I'd prefer the neutral reasons why.\
\
Section 3 is the methodological heart of the paper.\
It is very dense -- I would have preferred a more elaborate explanation.\
I am not an expert in the proposed methods, but they seem to make sense to me.\
Is a replication package available?\
\
"An often heard" --> Please add references to support any of these\
claims made in the paper.\
\
I am surprised to see recommendations mixed with presentation of the\
results in section 4.\
It would be preferable to have a clear section 4 with just neutral\
undisputed results.\
The next step to use these results to recommend certain practices is\
more debatable.\
\
The future work section sounds like a sales pitch for Cocomo III.\
"The rise of agile methods, web services, cloud\
services, parallelized software on multicore chips, field- programmablegate-\
array (FPGA) software, apps, widgets, and net-centric systems\
of systems (NCSOS)"\
"different development phenomena appear to drive the costs and\
schedules of web-services, business data processing, real-time embedded\
software, command and control, and engineering and scientific\
applications"\
"time-competitive Agile\
projects in well-jelled, domain-experienced rapid development organizations,\
which demonstrates tremendous effort reduction and\
schedule acceleration"\
\
This whole section does not add anything relevant to the paper.\
What is needed instead is a critical and focused assessment to what\
extent the experiments in this paper will survive in light of some of\
these developments.\
\
\
The paper feels very rushed: There are many typos and unfinished\
sentences in the paper.\
\
Additional remarks:\
\
Page 1: The quite impressive use of references in the Introduction, without\
extensive explanation, seems to assume that the reader knows about the\
referred background. The authors risk to lose the less experienced reader\
here.\
\
Page 1: In RQ1 suddenly the concept of Lines of Code pops up without\
mentioned in the introduction. Why is this particular measure chosen? The\
authors state that this is an "often heard, but rarely tested, comment": why\
is this not mentioned in the related work in the introduction (if it is\
often heard)?\
\
Page 6: Repeates the statement made in RQ1 on "an often heard, but not often\
tested, criticism of parametric estimation methods is that they are no\
better than just using simple lines of code measures". Seems questionable to\
me why the authors chose a statement as background for their first research\
question that is based on hearsay only, and not on earlier research.\
\
Page 1: In RQ2 a choice is made for "our 'best' learner, as well as\
case-based reasoning and regression trees"; why these? Why not others? I\
miss the explanation.\
\
Page 1: RQ4 seems to assume that deployment cost are a subject, why is this\
chosen? I miss the explanation.\
\
Page 8: Paragraph 4.4 mentions the aspect of multiple languages for the\
first time. I was pages before that already questioning how programming\
languages were to be related to the datasets used for the research, since I\
suppose there is a relation between KLOC and language. The paper does not\
tell me anything about this, while this can be of big influence for the\
outcomes of the research I suppose. Are this all data from one language?\
\
Page 9: Paragraph 5.1 last alinea; a suggestion is made towards the research\
community to spend a few years on variance reduction. How should this be\
done? The suggestion reads now as a bit bold.\
\
Page 10: On external validity: while only COCOMO related data is used to\
explore the research questions (Page 2), the title of the paper and the text\
in the abstract seem to generalize the findings to all parametric software\
estimation methods. This needs to be more clearly mentioned and explained in\
the Threats to Validity paragraph I would propose.\
\
Page 10; Conclusion; the researchers conclude that it is still valid and\
recommended practice to first try parametric estimation. However, they did\
not convince me why the addition first is covered by the research. Can't\
relate this conclusion to anything in the earlier paper, although a\
reference to paragraph 4.3.3. is made.\
\
Some minor remarks:\
\
Page 1: since Putnam is mentioned in the Introduction, I think it would be\
good to include also a recent critical paper that describes major weaknesses\
in this model; Suelmann, Han. "Putnam's Effort-Duration Trade-Off Law: Is\
the Software Estimation Problem Really Solved?." Software Measurement and\
the International Conference on Software Process and Product Measurement\
(IWSM-MENSURA), 2014 Joint Conference of the International Workshop on.\
IEEE, 2014.\
\
Page 1: Although I do agree with the statement that "Under-estimation can\
cause schedule and budget overruns as well as project cancellation" I think\
that the referred at article on "NASA to Shut Down Checkout & Launch Control\
System" [61] is maybe not the best example to illustrate this; the article\
does not clearly state that underestimation was a major cause (out of the\
many others).\
\
Page 4: Figure 4 text contains (I assume) a typo; "plus KLOC plus".\
\
Page 4: third line of paragraph 2.3 contains a typo; "pocedure".\
\
Page 10: top left alinea; isn't is a little bit too blusterous to state that\
".this is one of the most extensive and elaborate studies yet published"?\
\
Page 10; paragraph 8; sixth line contains a sort of "column outlier"\
("programmable").\
\
----------- STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES -----------\
+ effort estimation important topic\
+ recent theories challenged through experiments\
- poorly written paper that insufficiently separates neutral facts and\
observations from personal opinions.}
